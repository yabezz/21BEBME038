    <h3>How it works ?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h5>Introduction</h5>
        <p>
          An average calculator is a handy tool that helps you find the average
          (or mean) value of a set of numbers. Whether you're working on your
          homework, managing finances, or analyzing data, understanding how an
          average calculator works can make your tasks much easier. Let's delve
          into the simple process behind this essential tool.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>Step 1: Input Your Numbers</h5>
        <p>
          The first step is to input the numbers for which you want to find the
          average. This could be any set of numerical values, such as test
          scores, sales figures, or even household expenses. Most average
          calculators provide input fields where you can enter these numbers.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>Step 2: Summing Up</h5>
        <p>
          Once you've entered all your numbers, the average calculator adds them
          together. This process is known as "summing up" or "finding the
          total." It simply involves adding each of the numbers together to get
          a single total value.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>Step 3: Counting</h5>
        <p>
          Next, the average calculator counts the total number of values you
          entered. This count is crucial for finding the average because it
          tells us how many numbers are being averaged. For instance, if you
          entered five test scores, the count would be five.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>Step 4: Finding the Average</h5>
        <p>
          To calculate the average, the average calculator divides the sum of
          the numbers by the total count. This division operation gives us the
          average value. Mathematically, it's represented as:
        </p>
        <p>
          Average = (Sum of Numbers) / (Total Count) <br />For example, if you
          entered test scores of 80, 85, 90, 95, and 100, the sum would be 450
          (80 + 85 + 90 + 95 + 100) and the count would be 5. Dividing the sum
          by the count (450 รท 5) gives us an average score of 90.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>Step 5: Displaying the Result</h5>
        <p>
          Finally, the average calculator displays the calculated average value.
          This is usually presented clearly on the website interface, making it
          easy for you to see the result of your calculation.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>Conclusion:</h5>
        <p>
          And that's how an average calculator works! By following these simple
          steps, you can quickly find the average of any set of numbers. Whether
          you're crunching numbers for school, work, or personal use, this tool
          makes the process fast and efficient. So next time you need to find
          the average, just plug your numbers into the calculator and let it do
          the math for you!
